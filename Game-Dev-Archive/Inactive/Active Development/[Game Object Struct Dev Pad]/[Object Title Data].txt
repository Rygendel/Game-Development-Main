[Object basic Data]

[Description of object/struct class, system, type, and more (game-theory and game-mechanics of entire group/classification/type of objects/structs)]

[Object main Data]

[Describe object data structure]

[Describe and data/game-things for entire category of objects]

[then develop components/data/[aynu-data]/[aynu-code/symbols]/[aynu-text-things]/[aynu-glyphos-things]/[aynu-game-code/file-writing-document-things]/things/properties/things/[aynu]/[Iulion]/[Adrion]/[game-things]/...[more to develop] that define/characterize individual objects/structs/[Rygel]/[Adrion]/[aynu]/...[aynu-game-things]/[more things to develop]]
  [these are the things that give the objects all the interesting game-things that can make them game-desireable and give them life in the game, and make the game dynamic and interesting]
[describe concretely what they do/are/[aynu]/[aynu-theory-concept]:     ... ]

[more to develop]

[need to eventually redo this completely to write down some actual game data]

[this should contain all the data needed to understand and create the game; this is the game and needs no additional documentation or source code, this contains all of that]

[need to develop the ultimate thing I wrote down in some other file and need to develop further and write more code for it and write more things in its data-components, and write more [data/aynu-data/aynu-things]/[aynu]/[aynu-data-components] for it]
