Neopets-Like Design

- develop code, data, and markup language for expressing objects in this game

To start building the ultimate Endor game:

* Develop [Neopet-structs], items/objects/Rygel, game-world, subgames, plot, roleplay and relationships with other players, and much more

* Can form relationships with other players and roleplay in a common fantasy world with many others

* Neopets-structs:
  - Have stats/data/data-structs that determine how good they are at certain things -> develop these to make your struct good at certain things and then use your struct's strengths in gameplay or to acquire/do/be/[aynu]/[aynu-theory-concept]/.../[more to develop] things
