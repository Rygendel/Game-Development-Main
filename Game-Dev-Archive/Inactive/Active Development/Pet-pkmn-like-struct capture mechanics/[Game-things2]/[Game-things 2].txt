[Create a class of Game-play things that can be used in gameplay. These can both consume resources and generate them]

[some of these can be structs with special struct data and game-mechanics and game-systems that can process that data and provide a game engine for determining and creating the struct-gameplay in the arch-game-world relevant and produced by those stats]

[example: for a basic system, a struct can have atk, defense, health, speed stats and a set of moves they can use to fight gainst an opponent]

- can do and be anything in the game, has all of the [aynu-greatest] things/abilitites/collection-things/properties/[aynu]/[aynu-game-dev-collection-things]
