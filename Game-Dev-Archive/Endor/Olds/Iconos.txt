[develop Iconos Game and Gameplay here using Endor]

- icons are generated and used as a resource for attacks, moves, spells, abilities, things, items, and many other things

- certain structs and things focus on certain types/themes of icons (ex. wide variety versus a lot of a single kind)

- not all attacks, moves, spells, abilities, things, items, and many other things can be used by every Feanor; some may be restricted to certain kinds fo structs, and some may have stat/item/thing requirements to be used, or other restrictions on a struct's ability to use it
