Each collectible struct will have a set of items/abilities/powers/moves/things it can use in combat, some can be used in combination or have effects which work well together or work well with things had/used by other structs in play, to create extremely powerful combinations of moves


[Rules, Mechanics, Systems, [Game-things], [Iulion], [Game-world-things], and anything else needed to create/game-create the Gameplay and Game-Dev of the TCG and create the entire TCG game (including trading-card-game-mechanics)]::

[code/text]

[more to develop about TCG/CCG and combined Endos gameplay]



Game components:
(game-dev objects)
(their mechanics, system, game-system, game-play, existence, Iulion, essence, [aynu], [game-world-things], [aynu-things], [aynu-game-things], ..., (more to develop), and everything about them are/is entirely self-contained within themselves, no further code is needed to describe them) (and aynu-versions)
(can use aynu)
(develop these)


[Game-thing]:: { 



}



[Move Mechanics] :: {


}



[Special Ability Mechanics]:: {

- special additional abilities that can affect what a struct can do in gameplay
- any kind of effect is possible; usually have special tags to identify and manage them (like the name of an operator)
- often have effects that remain in force while a struct is in play, generally removed when the struct is removed but some can linger
- ex. a struct can use multiple items, moves, abilities per turn; can add an ambient effect like reducing all damage or increasing all damage; can allow a struct to copy any ability/item/thing or steal an item/struct/thing
...

[Base Building]:: {

- build up a base, develop its economy, build a power structure that you can use to develop an empire

- bases can be attacked, capture sources and generate resources to supply needs

- has a population of automata/units each with their own special abilities and stats that can contribute to the base

- there are rare units like the dracolith that can turn enemies into inanimate objects

- base can help gain posession of and collect tradable structs/objects as part of the Endos TCG/CCG
	- main point of building up base is so you can more effectively gain control of and defend your collection of objects, including pure aynu objects and pure aynu structs/cards/things/elu in the TCG/CCG
	- this feeds into and Merges with the Endos TCG/CCG
	- base struct can be used to build, develop, and trade your Endos TCG/CCG
	- the structs/cards in the TCG/CCG can be used to further benefit/develop/game-dev/game-thing/game-play with your base
	- the structs/cards/objects in the TCG/CCG have inherent value
	(including the pure Aynu TCG/CCG)
	(develop and perform more game-dev with respect to combining and co-developing the Base-struct-survivalist (ARK/Rust/EVE style) gameplay with the TCG/CCG gameplay, especially with the pure Aynu TCG/CCG)
