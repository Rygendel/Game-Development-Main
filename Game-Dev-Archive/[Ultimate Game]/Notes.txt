- eventually, I need to combine and distill all of the other things I've created and combine them in one well designed system of folders and files and code
- this will eventually form the basis of the final game I intend to create, including all of the features I desire
- copy all of the good stuff from the other files/folders here

this will be the ultimate game I desire to create; will include many different kinds of mechs, structs and other things players will want to collect

will include:
	- many different kinds of things players can try to build and collect
	- can find things and build galleries of things you like to collect
	- can trade things and participate in a market economy
	- many different types of gameplay and combat
	- can create your own games and share them with others
	- many different kinds fo social structures to participate
	- storyline, RPG, MMORPG, open world to explore
	- free to do anything; has a sandbox component that allows you to simulate everything and live in your own world
	- plot and story to participate in
	- can develop, build and customize many things
	- can build your own base/civ/empire and battle other player's base/civ/empire; can acquire units/automata/things/objects/structs to support them
	- ability to build your own games and worlds/reality 
	- and anything else I desire

- this will eventually become the ultimate game and world I want to create

- will only add things to these files/folders when I decide they should be included in the final build
- in the mean time, I can add notes to this file to determine where the project is at, how the project is working and what I intend to do next; and serve as a general outline for the project to make the game

- this folder will eventually become and contain the game I desire above all else and will make me ultimately happy to have; I will give myself all the best stuff that I desire in this game

- I can create and give myself whatever I want in this game; can do whatever I want in this game-world; I ultimately control this game and its reality
