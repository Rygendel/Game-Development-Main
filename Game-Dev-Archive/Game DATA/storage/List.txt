Things to build:

- Characters
- Draemon
- structs (the stuff in game.txt and abstract.txt)
- Tyrions/objects
- Sirions
- Machines
- World
- background mechanisms/gameplay 
- encapsulation of the game and a system


[these objects transcend all description, but are given by approximations, and are used to provide the background for everything related to the game]
- abstract concepts (including battle concepts): provide motivation/framework for structs to interact with, have value, engage in actions, and provide reasons for acquiring and using them
  -> provides a way to make objects desireable, useful, and any other good thing

- abstract classes: provide framework for interpreting data and giving the concrete data meaning

- aya: basic objects used to build everything; what they are transcends all things


- Describe the data and structs related to each structure (Characters/NPC, World, Items, Campaigns/Adventures/Story Arcs/Quests, Tasks/Things to do or collect/Achievements)
