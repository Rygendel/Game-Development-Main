This folder will hold work related to creating a template and background for the abstract-arch-game, as well as the materials needed to create your own abstract-games within the abstract-arch-game.

The arch-game in essence acts like a new universe for the player, where they can pursue their desires/goals/meaning in one of several canonical games, or create their own world to suit their own desires/wants, where they can make anything they want, and can create any kind of game-play systems (including player-interactions/combat/roleplay with other beings) and objects/things they desire. The arch-game is my world and created to suit my desires and be what I want; a place where I can achieve everything I've ever dreamed of and [abstractly-want/desire], raiku, and [any other abstract-aynu theory-concept].



For now focus on two projects:
- design game-system/mechanics creation (this also includes designing game-theories/concepts)
- create background for creating classes of game-structs, and interlocking them with the game-systems that endow them with interesting gameplay


Samples:
	Pokemon:

	Structs: 
		- pokemon, items, player characters, NPCs, etc
	Mechanics:
		- Pokemon-Battles, trading, pokemon-attributes, item useage/possession, ...

	Civilization (n):
	
	Structs:
		- civilizations, buildings, population, resources, etc
	Mechanics:
		- economy, happiness, city-development, warfare, diplomacy, research, ...	



- the main goal is to design a game where the players try to build up and develop some game-things that they possess and use to play the game and achieve game-goals; they can try to acquire wealth, special aynu-things, and many other things
