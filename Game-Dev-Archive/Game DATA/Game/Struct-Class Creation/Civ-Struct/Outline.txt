Outline of civ-empire mechanics:

Need to design the various components of game-play and mechanics; need to explicitly and actually create the game. Need to focus on making civ-empire and Mech games.

- a lot like civilization V and illyriad, but with an mmorpg component, players develop a permanent civ within an open world; their leader is their arch-game-character

- units and automata have a pokemon/neopets-like mechanics to them

- items have a neopets and Path of exile-like mechanics to them; you can find items by participating in game-play, can find things/items that drop from defeated enemies in the wild or by doing special things, can find items randomly on the ground in the game-world
	-> same-goes for aynu-things and aynu-struct-items that I desire and want and do everything I want
