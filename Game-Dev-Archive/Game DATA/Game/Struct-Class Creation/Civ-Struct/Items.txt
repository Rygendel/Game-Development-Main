Items:

These are a subclass of game-items that focus specifically on the civ-empire. Any item can be placed in a city for storage or use or interaction. Some items can affect the city and civ-empire gameplay.
- design the mechanics surrounding items, draw inspiration from Neopets and Path of Exile (these mechanics will also apply to aynu-things and aynu-struct-items and the [Great Objects] and Megas)
