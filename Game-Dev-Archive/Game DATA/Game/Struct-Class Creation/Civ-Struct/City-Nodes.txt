City Nodes:




Size and Population:

- Size determines the amount and level of development a city can support
- the population determines the number of automata/things within the city
	- population divided into two components: generic and automata
	- generic population are a basic stat: the members can't be differentiated and they are used much like a resource that isn't consumed
	- automata are special objects within a city; they are a struct on their own and have their own stats, powers, abilities, routes of development; and they have desires, goals, uses, relationships, roleplay, and much more
	- automata are "specialists" that you can use to do things for your city-node, you can assign automata to a task or thing that does something or grants some bonus to your city 
	- automata have a pokemon/neopets-like mechanics to them
