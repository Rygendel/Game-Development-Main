class of structs where I test out many different kinds of mechanics; can modify and develop any kind of game mechanics/model with these structs; and players can use these strucst to develop their own kinds of games:

Similar to mechs.

- can interact with any objects, but there are special objects that are designed specifically to interact with these structs
- need to work on designing these object further; design interesting gameplay and mechanics

Many different types of "basic nodes"; each class has its own inherent properties and ways of being acquired. Can add special things to them or develop them in a variety of ways including:

- passive dev tree
- research/



Components:

- [Power boost]

- [aynu-thing]-creator


- [population]-support facility



- [Great weapon]


- [thing that does some thing in the game-world]


- [any thing imaginable]


- [....]


-[thing that does some game-play thing]



- [thing that contributes to and affects game-play-battles/games in some way]
