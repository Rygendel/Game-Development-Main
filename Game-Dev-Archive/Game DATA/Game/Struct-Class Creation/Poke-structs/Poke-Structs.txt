Like pokemon/neopets, but set in an open world where players can interact with the world and go on adventures, trying to collect structs and things they desire.

There are many factors that distinguish each species; including possible development paths, values for stats, data-components, appearance, and many other things [to develop]


Collectible struct:


Base data:
[level]: Determines the kinds of things it can do, used to meet level requirements.
[attack]: [the base amount of damage dealt]
[defense]:
[power]:
[trait]:
[moves/powers]:
[thing]: (epcial thing, each species has its own set of things it can have)
[inventory]:
[special features and species data]: (these help to differentiate the different species and make them collectible/desireable to possess)
