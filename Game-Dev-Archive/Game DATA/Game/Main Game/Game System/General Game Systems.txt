Meta system: Constraints and Game-models/rules:
- most game-lay systems have restraints/constraints on your ability to do things or acquire things in order to make the game interesting: you have to play the game according to a set of laws/rules
Types of constraints include:
	-> available actions and number permitted
	-> resource limits and management ex. mana for actions, fuel supply
	-> rarity of things
	-> formula and explicit rules
	-> number of sockets/slots/space/nodes
	-> [any other type of system for defining game-mechanics]


Game-Models:

- pokemon
- neopets
- world of warcraft
- civ 5




Vendors and Crafting:
- players can sell/exchange special combinations of objects to certain NPC vendors for special things in return: the objects in the recipe must be packaged together
-> ex. certain combinations of items can be exchanged for a better item
-> see path of exile for a similar system
-> makes even seemingly worthless objects useful
- can sell any item for something, but typically optimal to aim for recipe sales
-> can get some really good things/structs/valuable things from vendor interactions and recipe sales


-> crafting benches can be used to craft certain classes of things, perform certain types of modifications to items or structs, or do any other type of thing with objects/things/structs to modify/develop/create them
