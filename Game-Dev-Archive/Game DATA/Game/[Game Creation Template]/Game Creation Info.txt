[game is a placeholder for something that transcends mortal imagination/understanding]
[create system and objects necessary for players to create their own game-worlds, that can be anything and allow the players to do/have/[abstract thing] anything]
Outline game-world creation mechanics:

Actual game-world contains three things: game-world engine, game-world-database (consisting of the actual game-things), and the game specification (containing all the information about the game)

	- game engine contains the code to actually run the game and its 	mechanics/systems/world/reality/gameplay/objects/structs/things/accounts/items/[abstract aynu things]
		- [thing] Engine
	- game database contains the actual game instance and its 	mechanics/systems/gameplay/objects/structs/things/accounts/items/[abstract aynu things]
		- [things] / [thing] Database
	- game spec contains all the information about the game and its 	mechanics/systems/gameplay/objects/structs/things/accounts/items/[abstract aynu things]
		- [thing] info
	the game spec contains concrete data about the actual game and its current state, and includes all the data necessary to construct the game

Can create anything about the game and store it in one of these folders
 


Game-world Creation Mechanics, engine, info, and objects:

[outline mechanics, engines, info, resources, things, powers, work, mechanics, and objects/materials/things/recipes/actions needed to develop and make your own game-world and the things/structs/mechanics/systems/objects/[abstract aynu-things] in it]


- create game-systems, game-mechanics, game-objects, accounts, game-engines, instances of game-things, etc...

---------------------

Game-World Development:

- development can include ongoing projects, game can be continuously developable and modifiable, new things can constantly be added/expanded, can include "slots" for players to expand the game in ways they desire; can create new games within the game and make it possible for players to create things or game-worlds within the game-world

- can make it possible for players to create anything, any [abstract-thing] or [abstract-game-thing] or [abstract-game-system/world/reality] within the game

- can create anything about the game; can create any type of game-world-reality desired, including new types that transcend understanding, with systems/things that transcend our understanding

- can do/make anything and any [aynu-thing]

- new content can continuously and autonomously develop

-can create any kind of player interaction

- can create [thing]

- can [thing]

-can develop [thing]: [how to develop thing]
