Outline all information relating to structs in this folder.

In general, all things related to structs transcend our ability to comprehend them, can only be encoded by the aya, and transcend mortal words. Summary aya-stats are used to help get an understanding of them (separate from the main aya-information).

Special types of structs:

Tyrion
Draemon

Files Involved:
Structure.txt: A general overview of the mechanics and structure of these structs.

Concepts.txt: Outlines the aya-concepts that, in an abstract and transcendental way, endow the aya-data with the desired things/meaning/value

Structure Notes.txt: Rough work on structs

Data.txt: Contains pre-built aya-data structures used to build the structs

Abstract Classes: Like concepts, they help to endow the aya-data with the desired things/meaning/value.

Catalog of Aya: contains data on the aya used to build everything.

(todo: finish outlining the mechanics to completely describe these structures)
(todo: build more structures)
