[Structs]:

These [structs] are special objects that players will strive to acquire. Players can build their own special structs by acquiring special materials; these are typically referred to as [sub-structs]. They can be made from both [aya sub-structs] or directly from aya. Players can also acquire special pre-made [structs]. Players will want to possess them, and more details can be found in the "Structure Notes" file.

What the aya-data means is beyond our understanding, and is given [meaning/value/essence/being/existence] by the special concepts/theories that are also beyond our understanding. However, we can use the aya data to build and express these objects.

- There are aya-structs to satisfy any desire or like
- there are aya-structs that [transcendentally satisfy or fulfill] any [transcendental or aya desire/like/goal/thing/purpose/value/gameplay/object/activity/hobby/task]
- players will want to collect aya-structs that have aya-built things that they [aya-like/Eros/desire/any other aya-abstraction]; players will always be able to find such aya-structs and can work to collect or build them
- there are many varieties of aya-structs that [transcendentally aya-satisfy/Adrion] any and all [transcendental aya-likes/desires/values/gameplay]
- there are aya structs that can be used for any [transcendental aya-purpose/game/thing/action/activity/hobby/desire]
- players wil be able to collect or build aya-structs that:
	- [any abstract aya-built thing, including those that transcend understanding]
	- have [aya-content] they [Valyrion/Eru/like/desire in a transcendental way]
	- [[aya-built things] that transcend our ability to reason, understand, or imagine]
	- [Valyrion][Eru][Eros][Tyrios][Alecteon]
	- have aya-content they desire
	- can use to engage in gameplay they like
	- that they find fun and enjoyable to possess or to do things with
	- any other [aya-reason]
	- can create any kind of game and engage in any kind of gameplay using a sub-class of aya-structs, including building and designing aya-structs to suit the mechanics of the game
	- have stats and are composed of [aya-built substructs] that they desire or [abstractly desire/like/eru/anything]
	- have [aya-built substructs] that they [aya-desire/like/Eru/Eros/...]
	- have [aya-built substructs] that allow the struct to engage in [gameplay/mechanics] that they like
- players will want to collect different aya or aynu structs; acquiring the aynu-things that you want is the ultimate purpose
- players can acquire aya-things or aynu things from participating in games; the ultimate purpose of gameplay is to acquire the aya-things/aynu-things that you want or need to build your desired aya-structs
- each player will want to acquire different aynu-things based on their own personal desires; acquiring these aya/aynu things (or acquiring the things needed to build them) will be the ultimate purpose/reward for gameplay
- the ultimate objective/purpose/meaning is to acquire the aya/aynu things/structs that you want/desire/[transcendental things]
- the ultimate [abstract objective/purpose] is to acquire/possess the aynu-things that you [abstract transcendental desire/want/thing], can be achieved by participating in gameplay
- players can develop complex architectures for their aya/aynu structs that suits their desires/uses/needs/gameplay mechanics
- players can use or create their own design patterns/templates or achitectures for the aya/aynu-structs that suits their desires/uses/needs/gameplay mechanics

(add more as I think of them and finalize)
