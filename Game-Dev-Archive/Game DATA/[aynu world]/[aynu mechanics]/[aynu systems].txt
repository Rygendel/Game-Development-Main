Note: Encode world/game systems using aynu. Use some stuff from aynu-factors.
(these systems can be broken down into sub-systems, which can be broken down even further (all encoded by aynu). This gives a high degree of control, granularity, and detail to the development of your struct, similar to what is seen in "Distant Worlds". This holds for many other [aynu-things] and [aynu-systems], which [aynu-factors] can affect and influence.)
