Notes: Decide on factors that [aynu][aynu]
(these factors can be broken down into sub-factors, which can be broken down even further (all encoded by aynu). This gives a high degree of control, granularity, and detail to the development of your struct, similar to what is seen in distant worlds. This holds for many other [aynu-things] and [aynu-systems], which [aynu-factors] can affect and influence.)
