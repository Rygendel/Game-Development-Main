- Develop gameplay mechanics using aya.
Gameplay stuff:
- develop objects and structures that are valen to build, develop, and interact with and compete with other players in developing and building
- players can acquire things that are used to develop these objects/make them better
- then these objects do/are better and contribute to various gameplay mechanics
[discuss these objects and their development and gameplay further]
[make their development involve strategy, high degree of structure and self-growth]
[can involve research, technology, resource gathering, building, acquiring things, questing, completing special tasks, doing special achievements and much more]
[describe how they are built with the aya and how their gameplay functions]

[Build special structures that have no direct parallel to anything, transcend description, transcendentally good]

[built structures that have gameplay mechanics]

[resources: elements, structures, etc]

- develop highly structured development/gaming/competition/creating/possessing/building/strategy mechanics involving all of these things
