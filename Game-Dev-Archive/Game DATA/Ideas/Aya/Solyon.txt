Solyon: [Abstract concepts, properties, things, good things, greatness, values, meanings, purpose, fun, uses, all good things that transcend description. Used to build other things, are possessed by other things and it is good and desirable, valen (transdesc) to have them (for something to have them or achieve them) ]

[The Solyon are good, useful and desirable in many different ways that transcend mortal understanding. Solyon transcend mortal imagination. They are abstract things that are good, useful, great and desirable to possess and be possessed by other things. They determine and endow things with abstract states, information, structure, and things that transcend description but which are desirable and great beyond mortal comprehension.]

[Need to describe how these give rise to the fundamental purpose (abstract). It is Valen to have these, and they satisfy all needs/desires]

[Add best description possible, and then take it's version that transcends mortal understanding.]
 ex.:

[" Like the basic Aya, these transcend mortal understanding. However these things are more than the aya, have desirable things (transdesc) and uses that lead to abstractly interesting mechanics and fun(valen) gameplay. High degree of variation, they are, posses and do many different things. They are the things which have meaning, value, structure, purpose, use, Valyron,... (all in ways that transcend mortal understanding), and transmit these things to the abstract objects they are used to build"]

Abstractly desirable: Valyron (the ultimate good thing, in a way that transcends description, can be achieved in many ways by things built with aea such as solyon)

The Solyon are the abstract concepts used to create the world and the theory and structure of all of the things in it. These concepts transcend our own understanding, but we can use some approximation.
