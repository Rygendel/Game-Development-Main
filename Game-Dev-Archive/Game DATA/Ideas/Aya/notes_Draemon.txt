Draemon:
--------
(I will experiment with the Draemon, build them in an interesting way that leads to abstract gameplay)

Describe how aya are acquired, build them up, and make them good/desirable/useful/great/... in ways that go beyond mortal understanding 

(find description to make these things the best/good/most desirable things)

[objects which transcend mortal comprehension, desirable]

[create/experiment/develop ways to build these from aya and other things, make them desirable to acquire/possess (in transcendental ways), and give them abstract value/desirability/purpose/goodness/meaning (that transcends understanding) in game, which will mostly come from the aya/other things]

[give them things which transcend our understanding, using the aya]

[they transcend all mortal concepts, notions, objects, imagination]

[they do/are/possess things we can not comprehend]

[(create a description that makes draemon the best/greatest, and do everything I want)]

[experiment with their structure, function, nature (which transcends understanding)]
