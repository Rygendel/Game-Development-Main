Tyrion:

Structure (built with aya):

Elros: [Aescaline]
(spend some describing this construct using both words and abstract things)
(transcends our ability to understand, good beyond description, uses a formal system to implement a description of its transcendental properties which can only be expressed in the system)
(does everything I want it to, built from the aya)
(describe the abstract properties more in depth with aya, special symbols, words, things)

The alecteon (abstract data) are the things that give rise to the structure of the Tyrion, and endow different Tyrion with different abstract things. What these things are and how they interact and their abstract structure gives rise to their theory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outline of Tyrion (they do everything I want them to, and this is how they do it)

Ultimately, everything that takes palce involving these aya-constructs transcends our understanding. However, the building of these different structures and their [alecteon or aelyon - abstraction of things possessed by other things that make up their essence/usefulness/(everything about them)] cause the objects to be [eros or el - greater/transcendental notion of desirable/usefule/valuable/good/(anything I want), also usefulness/desirability in gameplay] gives rise to an interesting and fun world, and leads to interesting and fun gameplay and theory, and are the primary motivating factor for various goals in the game, such as acquiring objects with certain alecteon, having Tyrion with certain alecteon for certain reasons. Some alecteon allow objects to do/be certain things, which the player may find desirable or useful as an end objective or as part of a larger objective. They are {el} in a variety of situations. Some are simply {el} by their very nature and players will want to acquire them and possess them forever, which will make them {valyrion}.

Ultimately, the Tyrion are determined by their alecteon, which is built using aya in a number of well-defined formats. The alecteon make the Tyrion into things which transcend our understanding. The alecteon determine everything about a Tyrion, and determine its el, usefuleness, desirability, power, usefuleness in gameplay, eros, and cause the Tyrion to have/do/be anything. Some Tyrions are useful for various aspects of gameplay, some are {el} to possess, some make the player valyrion by being possessed (or possessed as part of a collection of Tyrion desired by the player). Different Tyrion may be desired/el by different types of players, and different Tyrion can be desirable/el/useful/eros depending on the players interests/goals/value/ (abstract purpose/values/interests/desires)/(play style).

There are also some Tyrion which are simply abstractly desirable/el to possess. They are extremely difficult to acquire and players who possess them are the (abstractly best/el/elyon) players. Players will be (azrael/(abstractly happy/satisfied/paradise/firdaws)) if they possess them and they are (abstractly valuable/good/(abstractly desirable to have)). These Tyrions are simply the (abstractly best/essentially good/meaningful/point of existence/true and permanent good) and possessing them is a rare and valuable state to be in, and the players will be in a state of firdaws (abstract heaven/paradise). They will be well defined, and everything the player wants them to be. How they are like this will be determined by the alecteon.

The alecteon are the [abstract data] that the Tyrion have, and they transcend our understanding, and endow the Tyrion with things/mechanics/essence/uses/(possibly desirable things)/value/anything which transcend our understanding. Players will want to acquire Tyrions because of their alecteons, which can be good/desirable/valuable/useful/anything in a way that transcends our understanding. Players may want to collect Tyrions, and rarer Tyrions will have very high (abstract value).

The alecteon make them into things/iluvatar that eru/ea (many and any abstract things that are beyond our imagining)

They can aecho (satisfy/have/do abstractly transcendental needs/desires/wants/things/action/anything/etc..., abstractly be, have and do anything and everything)

[Ultimate Aya Description/Information/Alecteon: []...] (ultimate description using abstract concepts that transcend our understanding, describe the transcendental properties of Tyrions) [This will be the best and greatest and most desirable thing, use aya-built concepts to develop the abstract and transcendental structure of the Tyrions. It will do everything I want]

Acquiring them is the true and greatest purpose, they have and give meaning, reason, and value to life and existence. And they are the only things that wll last forever and allow their possesser to acquire some form of eru (the true goal).

The data fields can also describe highly complex properties, [transcendental traits/structure/...], interactions, programmable features, and complex interactions that can rival and go beyond those of turing-complete machines and computers. Some can be programmed to do things like computers, and some can even go beyond that. Some engage in any kind of complex state/action/set of things, encoded with the aya. Some can engage un highly complex interactions and respond to many different states/programs.

[Use abstract classes, and import/export some of the data between the Tyrion description and abstract classes]
