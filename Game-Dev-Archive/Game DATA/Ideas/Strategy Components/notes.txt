- Players develop their (possibly city-like) structure (or something that does not resemble a city)
- these structures could possibly be things that transcend any mortal concept (but we use the placeholder of "city" or "polis")
- can construct structures(abstract) that do things such as generate resources, allow players to construct things, or have effects, or other abstract things
- players are represented by a character that controls the polis
- players can trade, sell objects, work towards building/acquiring abstract objects
- players can go on quests, engage in world exploraration
- players can fight in battles, wars
- players can compete in other areas
- players can become great traders, run corporations
- players and the population can come from different races
- players can build, develop, create, acquire, and store many different kinds of objects, many of which have various uses

- players have a "domain" and they can build or create thing in their domain to do things, such as generate aya-built structures, battle opponents domains, generate trade, craft things, or anything else
- players can specialize and customize their domain to have special structures, abilities, things etc.
- limitations force players to choose their own path, manage resources and abilities/structures
- players can choose their type of domain to begin with, customize, and gain access to more space or types of structures

-this is the game where the aya are relevant and where the aya-constructed objects can be acquired and will be useful/desirable/relevant/meaningful/possess/good/great/(everything I want them to be)

- can build many different kinds of structures that can do and be many abstract things, possess many abstract properties

- can build and code structures to carry out a variety of actions, do things, be things, or have things (need to describe how these structures are built/coded, and how the things they do affect the world and are desirable)

- players build a collection of structs they can use to do things

---------------------------------
[Final version of game outline]

- outline:
  - player creation
  - main structure they will be building
    - substructures that can be built and developed, and which have an effect
    - "minions/chars" which are agents which can carry out tasks, have stats, and can be developed
  - objects they can acquire, and their effects/usefulness/desirability, and how to acquire them
  - develop some of the abstract things using aya
  - outline combat/interaction
  - outline quests, exploration, building

--------------------------------------------------------

  Players:
  - character will belong to one of [n] races, each with characteristics
  - player initial stats will be partially randomized
  - can acquire special desirable/good objects such as Tyrion
  - can build strucutres (Erenion) that do things and are important and fun

--------------------------------------------------------

  Main structure [Erenion]
  - will have a pair of co-ordinates to determine location
  - wil have a series of attributes
  - attributes can be developed by specific actions, developing


  Attributes/Structure
  - some of it is built by aya, some in plain english
  - resources take time, skill, and access to special things in order to build
  - various attributes and values those attributes can acquire, and they are determined by the values the payer has in that attribute
  - can unlock special features, acquire new technology/abilities/structures/information/objects/things
  - can perform quests and special achievements to get things
  - structures/attributes can acquire additional features, abilities, traits, effects, things, objects, interact with things, and have effects
  - can build units/structures that do special things, units/structures have their own development track, tasks, ways to develop and specialize, abilities and features they can acquire, objects they can possess, actions and effects, and much more
  - these units and structures can then be used and played with, do and be things

  The Basic stats of the main structure (Erenion) are:

  - Estell
  - Auridon
  - Marion
  - [sym999] (production-like thing)
  - [tel2398] (gathering - like thing)
  - [tor9884] (special-crafting-like thing)
  - [warfarin9830] (involved in combat/competition)
  - [tel989] (trading-like thing)

  Some structures you can build:

	Tyrannos: 
	Main [Abstract thing corresponding to traits, features, useful things possessed]

ex. Titan unit can be built, has several main development tracks, including: daemonic, secret fire, drakonos. can acquire abilities and traits/development along each track.



  The possible specializations:


  The possible values (these will be concepts built with aya) 
  
  Abilities/Interactions

  Things:
--------------------------------------------------------

  Objects
  - include Tyrion, Draemon, and other things built with the aya
  - can be bought, sold, crafted possessed, used, and interacted with in many [transcendental] ways
  - their effects and nature are determined by the aya-objects used to build them


---------------------------------------------
Storyline/Environment:
Players fight various monsters using their vrious structures, characters.
Lovecraftian style horror.
Old Gods
Other Worlds, portals
Players fight to defeat monsters, gain the monster as a trophy which can be used or traded for other things.
Monsters have stats and attributes that determine what combat style/abilities work against them, there are many different types, and these different types have different uses once acquired.
Players can also acquire various (relics of the ancient ones).
Cosmic Horror, travel to dimensions and realms beyond imagining, stretching the limits of sanity.
