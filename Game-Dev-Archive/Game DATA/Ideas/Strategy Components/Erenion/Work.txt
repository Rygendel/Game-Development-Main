Erenion:

- the main structure that players can build and develop
- can acquire things that are good/desireable/useful/(everything and anything you could want)
- Can be used to compete or do many different things
- can be or have anything, players can have their structures follow any trajectory they want
- developing these structures takes a considerable investment requires a lot of time and skill
- requires strategy
- developing these is very valuable, fun and meaningful

(more to come)

Categories/Things to develop and their values/classes/ranks/objects/etc (developed with aya)

Tyraeos:
Arkadios:
Eldraeon:
Ellegon:
Rygulon:
Gallos:


Outline of mechanics:

Players acquire a [Erenion Soul] - choose initial (class)
- can develop (class), acquire new (categories) which can be developed as well

(need to outline what they can develop, how they develop it)

- can acquire Solyons (discuss this further)

- Erenion can also acquire other aya-built things like Draemons and Tyrions (these are like objects and are held or "owned" by the erenion, different from the way classes or categories are built)

- can use special sym, tyr, elon, ero etc constructions

Initialization process:

- decide name
- decide (can take one) amongst (n) initial structs (Elon, Auros, Rea, Galo, Pharos, Vala, 
- Build initial values using aya or solyon
