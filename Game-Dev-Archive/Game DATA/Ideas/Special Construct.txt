Constructs:

This will contain all of the special constructions used to do things in game, such as encode information, process things, and much more.

Players can create their own structures.

Fundamental Objects:

These are the basic abstract things/structures which (represent the basic things/concepts/structures which determine whether something is "fundamentally good/great/desirable/useful/abstractly great") determine everything.

(to write more to make these things the ultimate concepts/things/structures used to develop the objects players will want to acquire)
(players can develop their own versions useing structures)

(need to focus on this development, these will be the final most basic things, feel free to modify this text to suit fundamental needs/desires)

(make these the best things, elysion)

(describe their structure, information, abstract properties, interactions)

(these are the fundamental things which are used to create and endow things with anything, results in diversity, variation, (abstract great) things)

(need to work on finding more ways to express how these are the (best/good/ultimate thing) responsible for creating the most desirable components of the game)

Can't be expressed in common terms, resort to abstract symbolic representation. These are the fundamental concepts/things used to build/create everything and structure/existence. In terms of abstract fundamental properties. In terms of [-]

Their nature can't be expressed in mortal words, need no further justification for their [greatness], and they [transcend any mortal expression]. Might use divine/immortal words as expressing their information. They are just abstractly the things which create things and give them everything/meaning/structure/interaction/usefulness/desirability/good/great/[all other good things]/... .

[are the only things to have (abstract value) (abstractly special)]

Can be used to build/create anything/everything

[These things are the best things that will do all of the good things I want them to]
[They are typically considered good/great/best. They are typicaly considered transcendentally desirable, source of happiness and paradise]
[They transcend description, they simply are the atomic/basic things]
[I'll use them to create things that are (desirable/have purpose/meaning/value in a greater way that transcends description)]
[They are the source of (purpose/desirable/usefulness/all good stuff) - in a a way that transcends description]

[they simply are what they are]
[Most consist of a physical representation, sometimes accompanied by immortal words/symbols/glyphs... but otherwise they transcend any description]

[these things will eventually be the basis of all things]
[things will have these things, have their being determined by them]
[these will be used in the description/categories of information, and used to build up objects/information/descriptions]
[objects will be [determined] by the aea used/given/possessed]
[will be used to build up objects by being used in their (description/categories of information): when used there, the object is [affected/determined] by the aea used]
[the aea will be [attached/used in their information sheet] and will endow the object with themselves (things which transcend existence)]
[since these are the atomic things, there is no mortal way to describe how they affect/build-up objects, they simply are/do what they are/do]
[they simply build structure, no way to describe what they do in mortal words]
[they simply appear in the information/description, and they are simply possessed and their essence/representation affects the essence of the object]
[in conjunction with the other aea they determine/create (the essence/soul of) all things]
[their use in the description completely determines their (transcendental - effect/possession/influence) on the object, and can be used in different ways]
[they are (used in the information categories of an object) and (modify/influence/have an effect) which can't be described and transcends mortal words]
[they will be encoded using their representations on to the information sheet of various objects (in various ways and categories), and will do/give/endow things to the object that transcend mortal words and descriptions]
[the things they do/endow/give to objects are typically considered "good/desirable/great/..." but transcend mortal description]

Elements:

Fundamental elements that make up all standard objects. Their properties and how they are manipulated/combined determine the characteristics of all objects.
