This category adds many abstract concepts to an object, which extend the notions of desirability, usefulness, value, wish, good, great, and many other good notions.

Tyrael is a component of items, special objects, esdraelon. Adds aeonar, aeron. (It has uses). (Having some Tyrael can be desirable.)

[Develop and encode special things that encode structure, abstract things, actions, theory, evolutions, interaction, desire, tyrael, abstract desirability, other abstract things that are good and that I need to come up with, special things that can be added and developed, more things which can be made by the owner]
