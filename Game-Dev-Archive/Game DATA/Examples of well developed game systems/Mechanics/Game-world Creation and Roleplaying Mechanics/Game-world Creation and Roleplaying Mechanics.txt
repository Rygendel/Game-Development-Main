- The game-world, game-things and gameplay include game-systems/mechanics/stats/things that allow players to create their own world/gameworld/reality/universe and gameplay/roleplay/live/do-game-things in this universe

- that is, players can create their own [Ekron] or game and game-world/reality using the game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] of the main arch-game and can roleplay in it with other players, possibly many others. They can use any game-things/game-components/game-mechanics/systems/models/theory/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/concepts/[aynu-things]/[aynu-concepts]/worlds and game-objects/game-structs in their own game-world/game to create it and as part of their roleplay, and can create anything they can imagine/construct/dream, and even create things/aynu-things that transcend mortal comprehension (and can only be expressed using aynu-code and aynu-theory/concepts).
	->  can give the player's created Ekron/game/game-world any game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] by using game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] from the main arch-game or any of its other games


- ex. they can use their base as a home and furniture as furniture, and do the kinds of things people normally do at their homes with their furniture, using their player-character; their character will be able to do anything a real character could do in real life


- players can live in and roleplay any things they want; can create for themselves the kind of [Ekron]/[aynu-thing]/[thing]/game-world or game-reality they desire/[abstract-aynu-desire] and want to experience and can game-live/game-play in/roleplay in, participate in the world and interact with it, gameplay with it and in essence "live and create the story"
	- they can do things that advance the storyline/universe/world/plot in the world they are in and share with other players; you can have many players participate in a shared plot/storyline/roleplaying game-world and their game-interaction and game-actions will advance the storyline and determine how that world develops and what happens in their game-story/plot
	- they can develop relationships between players in the game-world, and go on any kind of adventures/[abstract-aynu-adventures]
	- essentially the players are part of their own story/anime/movie that doesn't end and is open ended and persistent; their created game-world is part of the main arch-game world and uses game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] from it; 
	- essentially using the game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] from the main arch-game they are able to create their own world where they can participate in an imaginary world/story/plot with other players: their game-play actions are their actions in the imaginary world and they are effectively living and existing in this imaginary world through the arch-game, and they can do so with other players and have relationships and do any kind of things they want to, or go on adventures/[abstract-aynu-fun-adventures], within the rules that they set and agree to with others

-> players can create any kind of game-world/Ekron/[abstract-aynu-world]/[aynu-world]/[aynu-reality/universe]

- Players can create their own Ekron and give their Ekron any game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] by using game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] from the main arch-game or any of its other games; there are mechanics built into the game to allow players to create their own Ekron and give it things

- players can collect and use game-items/structs/objects as part of their roleplay/Ekron; players can create items/objects/structs/aynu-things/[things] in their Ekron and use/do-things/gameplay/roleplay with them; can create wonderful environments/landscapes/worlds and roleplay in them; can engage in many different kinds of item/object/struct/[aynu-thing]/[thing] mechanics/systems/gameplay like trading, collecting, gallery-making, using, playing with, game-playing with, [Aria], [Aynu-things], [things], and many other things



- Develop mechanics for players to create their own Ekron or imaginary game-world and roleplay in it using the game-world and game-things/game-structs/game-objects/game-environments; possibly with other players:

ex. They can create their own Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Digimon, Yugioh, Zoids, or any other kind of universe and go on adventures, quests, stories, plots, lifestyle, gameplay, [abstract aynu-adventures], [things], [abstract-aynu-things], [abstract story-plot-reality], [many other things], and relationships in it and with other players
