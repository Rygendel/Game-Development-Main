Use these words to express abstract concepts I've been having difficulty describing. Ultimately, these concepts transcend mortal understanding and mortal words fail to truly describe them, but the attached descriptions give a crude approximation.

Ryku: Ultimate satisfaction/happiness (copy the description) [transcend mortal understanding]

Megas: [class of game objects that are the main things I will try to acquire/collect] [......] [todo: descr]

Adrion: [Things like gameplay data, gameplay code, things etc. that make up the game objects and are used to create game-things; essentially "game-things"; a thing's Adrion determines its place in the game and what it does, everything about it in the game and its value/meaning/purpose/skills/powers/effects/appearance/desireability/goodnes/[abstract aynu-things]/[aynu-things]/[things] and any other thing, including things that transcend mortal comprehension][More things that transcend human comprehension]


Iulian: [Abstract Game mechanics/systems/models/formulas/gameplay; the fundamental essence of a game that makes it fun]

Aurelius: Abstractly valuable and with inherent abstract-aynu-value/meaning/purpose/greatnedd that transcends all else; the kind of things players will want to possess in arbitrarily large quantities. It is inherently desireable in a way that transcends our ability to describe; there is so much more good stuff to this that simply can't be described using mortal words, can only use aynu. Shares its name with the [Aurelius] resource that is itself a kind of Aurelius. The more you have, the better off you are and the better your game-account and game-things are in a way that transcends our ability to describe. The more you have, the better you are in the game according to all game-theory in a way that transcends mortal description and can only be expressed using aynu. [more to add, mostly deferring to aynu]

Ho-megas: The greatest thing

Elysion: Abstract greatest thing/paradise.

Aria: Abstract aynu-fun/enjoyment gained from playing games you like; transcends our mortal comprehension. [Aynu code for it]

Asphodel: Aurelius objects that go beyond mortal comprehension, and can only be understood through their aynu-code. But as a crude approximation, this is the class of objects that are the ultimate and greatest things to have, possess, and engage in gameplay/Iulion with. They have the Elysion Ho-megas Adrion, and any player can achieve any kind of Ryku by possessing and game-playing with them. [add the ultimate description]. Anything with Asphodel is something which I and any other being [abstractly desire/want] and which allows me to achieve [abstract aynu-fun]/[Aria]/[Ryku] by possessing and game-playing with the Asphodel objects I desire
[Need to develop the Asphodel concept more, add in the ultimate description so that anything marked with Asphodel is in a class of objects that are the Ho-megas/greatest things any being could want and satisfy; that possessing and gameplaying with them is the greatest Aria/Elysion/Iulion/Adrion, and that any being would be abstractly-happy/Ryku and have the greatest Aria by possessing them and gameplaying with them (or at least the right kinds of them)]

[Need to develop the Asphodel more, add in the ultimate description, also the aynu-code, so that way anything marked with Asphodel is in a class objects that do everything I want and achieve all of my goals and game-creation desires; and so that possessing the right kind of objects in this class and game-playing/[abstract aynu-gameplaying] with them will allow me to achieve Ryku, have Aria, aynu-things, things, and make me happy and satisfied and meet all of my wants/desires, goals, purposes, aynu-things, things, and values that I have been trying to meet and get by creating these games; I will then give myself these objects and place them in my inventory/base]

[objects marked with asphodel will be able to engage the in the ultimate gameplay that will always and forever be fun/abstractly-fun/Aria and which players will be able to generate infinite Ryku/Elysion from playing/game-playing/abstract-aynu-gameplaying]

[More to come, but really all of the information is coded in the aynu, since everything about these concepts, especially Asphodel, transcends mortal comprehension and description]

[Aynu-code for Asphodel; ultimately this will completely encapsulate the concept, Asphodel, and will be the source of the most important things I desire] 


--------------

Ekron: [Ultimately transcends mortal description and can only be encoded in aynu and expressed using aynu-concepts] [Aynu-code that makes up Ekron]

English approximation: A game-world/reality/universe with a certain set of game-rules/laws. the game-world is open, persistent, and shared with other players, and players are free to do any kind of thing in this world and participate in any kind of gameplay allowed by the rules. Players can roleplay with other characters and create their own storlyine/life-history by playing the game, doing things in the game-world, and interacting with other players and developing relationships with them. Kind of like creating your own open ended movie/anime/story by playing a game and roleplaying inside an open, persistent, and shared world with other players and with no ending. Instead of using your imagination to create and do things in your story, you play the game and the game encodes your imaginary story/roleplay.

- essentially an ekron is a kind of alternate game-world/reality with its own set of game-things/laws/systems/things/story/"basis"

ex. Pokemon is an Ekron centered around creatures called pokemon and the world and mechanics surrounding them; a player could create their own version of the Pokemon Ekron and play as Ash and go around catching pokemon and doing things like stopping Team rocket

Yu-Gi-Oh is an Ekron centered around a card game and the magical stuff bnehind it; players can roleplay as a duelist

Dragonball Z is another example centered around Dragonballs and combat; players can roleplay as a hero who fights enemies/monsters like Cell (and have people absorbed by cell)

- Players can create their own Ekron and give their Ekron any game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] by using game-things/characters/systems/mechanics/story/plot/quests/world/tools/models/objects/structs/[Adrion]/[Iulion]/[things]/[aynu-things] from the main arch-game or any of its other games; there are mechanics built into the game to allow players to create their own Ekron and give it things

- players can collect and use game-items/structs/objects as part of their roleplay/Ekron; players can create items/objects/structs/aynu-things/[things] in their Ekron and use/do-things/gameplay/roleplay with them; can create wonderful environments/landscapes/worlds and roleplay in them
