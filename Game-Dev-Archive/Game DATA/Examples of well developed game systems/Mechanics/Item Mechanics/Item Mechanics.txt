[Write everything about the mechanic/model/system/formula here, explain fully how it works with enough detail to create it precisely, explain how it interacts with objects and the larger game world, creates fun/[abstract-aynu-fun]/interesting/rich-theory gameplay and gamethings, what it does, and motivate why players might want to use it or interact with it, and what they can get out of it, what stats it might use and how it might use them; how it can add value/power to an object based on the way the object interacts with the mechanic, what things this mechanic gives the object, or how "good" it is with respect to this mechanic]
