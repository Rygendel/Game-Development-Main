Note: These actually are the objects: having the file in your inventory is equivalent of possessing them; these files create the objects in the game world and manipulating the files is equivalent to manipulating the objects. Like TRading/colectible cards; possessing the file is equivalent to possessing the object in the game and allows you to use it in the game.
