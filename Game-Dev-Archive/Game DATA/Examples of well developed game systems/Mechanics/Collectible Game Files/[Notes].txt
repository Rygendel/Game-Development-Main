name for these collectible game file-things:: Megas

- need to find a way to make Megas desireable/[abstract-aynu desireable]/ryku:: probably by creating gameplay involving them and a game world where Megas are valued above all else; like pokemon

- find a way to make Megas do everything I want; create a game world themed around Megas;

- some Megas are the "best things" and make everyone want to have them; then I will give them to myself and add them to my account

- Megas are extremely diverse in their abilities, [Iulian], and gameplay; some things are really good at certain things, some are a little good at many different things, etc.

- Many different kinds of Megas with many different properties/[Iulian]/[Adrion]; players can try to collect different kinds of Megas and different kinds of players will value different kinds of Megas based on their data/things; each player's goal will be to try to get the Megas they desire/[abstract-desire]/ryku based on their data/values/properties/things/[abstract-aynu-things]/[Adrion] and their interaction with [Iulian]

- players will enjoy gameplaying/[Iulian-ing] with different kinds of Megas; the gameplay and style of a Megas and everything else is determined by its data/values/properties/[aynu]/[aynu-things] and this determines which Megas a player will want/desire/ryku/[abstract aynu-want] and in what ways they will want/game-play and how much and any other thing
