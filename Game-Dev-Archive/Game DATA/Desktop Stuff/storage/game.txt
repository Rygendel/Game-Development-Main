- players use/build structures (use abstract outline, use aya vals)
- players develop some of their own structures, and win/acquire rare-pre-built structures with access to rare and special abilities/things/values
- (use illyriad/(reward structs)?)
- structures can do things, compete in games, etc, go on adventure, campaign, pursue purpose/meaning

- can be combined, possess special things,
- have value based on what they are, how they interact
- can do useful things like generate/help build things the player wants such as Tyrions, resources
- can be useful in combat
- can be useful in many other pursuits/desires
- development trees/structs
- divided into special classes/creatures - have preset stats/features/rarity/characteristics, as well as development structs
- can use some features from pokemon/neopets, but allow much more freedom in development
- ex:

- some structs are completely programmable
  -- i.e. players can define and encode their theory, interactions, information, data,      interface, functions, operations, methods, structure, nature, etc. 
  -- there are some pre-programmed structures that can be invoked (a sort of standard      library) and used
  -- use well defined aya-based language
- some structs are initialized from a choice of default basic/baby "creatures"/"template"/base builds -> they are then developed and customized to become unique, fulfill desires/goals
- the creatures can be found and acquired by various means and with different initial features/characterstics/abilities - the type of creature also affects its development/ability to be developed in some ways
- they can acquire and develop other structs/Tyrions, such as battle structs used in the main combat
Things to develop:
- Sirion (completely programable?)
- Draemon (semi-programmable/creature-type struct that can be developed along well-defined tracks, can acuire special abstract traits/structs/things/tyrions/sirions)
- Tyrion (used for item/abstract object structs)
- ???


Battle Structs

- struct Malygos {
  [thing]::
  affylon:: Obliterate anything engaged by this object

}

- struct Nemesis {
  [thing]::
  [thing]::
  Affylon:: Gain control of an object engaged by Nemesis.

}


- Machine-class things (Makine):
  - can enter special states, receive instructions, can be programmed, execute tasks, become different things, produce and create different things
  - various Makine possess different characteristics

Battle Items and Battle Structs:
Players can acquire generic classes of items or structs. These can be developed and modified using items or special powers/bonuses/rewards. Players can add special modifiers/effects, improve stats, and otherwise develop items/structs to do the things they want.
