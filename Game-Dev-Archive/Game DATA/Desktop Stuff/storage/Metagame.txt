Outline long-term, open-ended gameplay here.

Most of the gameplay is open ended, where players play games and do things in the persistent world indefinitely. New content is constantly being added. New areas and things to explore are constantly being added. By allowing for open ended objectives, quests, content, and long term, extendible goals, players will be able to partcipate in an indefinite amount of gameplay and fun. Player development and acquired objects, wealth, things, structs, achievements, abstract things, owned and developed structures, are permanent and exist within the persistent world and can be developed as much as the player wants, and can influence and affect things in the game forever. Player developments can be permanent, and players can permanently acquire abilities, features, things, items, aya-things, aya-objects, [anything], and wealth. Player actions can have a permanent effect on the game and the persistent world, and help build up the game and the open, persistent world (in effect developing an open-ended story). 

- In some ways, similar to neopets (especially the economy). In some ways it is similar to MMORPGs (like WoW) (expecially in the persistent world and the number of different things to do and different kinds of open-ended content to participate in)

- Collecting, developing and acquiring aya-structs and aya-things is the most desirable, valuable, meaningful and [any other good thing] form of gameplay, motivates a lot of long-term, open-ended gameplay

- players can acquire these aya-things/aya-structs and hold onto them indefinitely or sell/trade them

- players may also wish to acquire a lot of wealth by acquiring valuable things, building a large bank account, or by investing in companies by purchasing stocks (either selling the stocks later or taking advantage of the things the company gives to players who own a share of the company, such as money)

- players can buy shares of companies; they become part owners depending on the share of the stock

- depending on how the stock performs, the stock value may rise, and the company may reward shareholders with some things, items, or money (the things the company gives the player depends on how well they do, what percentage of the company the player owns, and what type of company it is, and some other factors)

- players can develop their home

- players can develop their gallery, which stores and displays collected items, aya things, aya-structs that the player owns 

- players can trade, build, explore, battle, pursue side goals, etc.

- players can build many different kinds of structs that do/are many different things, can explore lore, side missions, storyline

- there is a massive player driven economy with a number of different kinds of currency objects each with their own inherent value, and some with their own uses (or things)

- many other things coming soon
