Structs/Buildings:
-------------------

- add special symbols/glyphs to the aya: each aya has a name and a special glyph/symbol associated with it that encapsulates it: both can be used to represent/be the aya. The symbols will look nicer and be aesthetically more pleasing

ex: Tyrael  - [sym]
    Elysion - [sym]
    Tyrion  - [sym]

- the players has a a single character used across all the different games. In the city-structs game, he is the leader of a civilization that he aims to develop along one of many different tracks such as science, economy, military, diplomatic, etc.
- across each of the games the player will try to acquire aya-things, as well as wealth in various other forms such as items, money, powerful structs, [doing well in various games]
- overall the arch-game has a neopets-like economy driven by acquiring as much [game currency] as possible and acquiring objects/aya-structs of high value
- acquiring and building aya-things and aya-structs is the greatest and most desirable goal/purpose, but there are many others

- the main game is a "sandbox-like" MMO. There are no set goals, and players can develop their structs for any purpose they desire.

(need to split this document up and consolidat the mechanics/list of traits)

Factor Affecting Structs: (need to develop this)
- sub-structs built into it (main thing, allows for wide array of open ended development)
- traits (Allows players to target specific goals)
- tech (allow splayers to target specific goals)
- special abstract things [allow for open ended-development]
- stats

Possible Goals include:
- having the largest economy
- being the best at crafting certain aya-things
- having the most powerful structs
- being the best at a certain game (like capture the flag/thing)
- be the best at certain quests/tasks
- roleplay
- gain influence
- anything else: players can develop their own games or roleplaying within the game, can develop their own lives/purpose, can create their own world/reality within the game (since it is a "sandbox"), and they can do this with other players, and have relationships with them

Basic Resources:
- generated by several basic structs given to every city
- can store a maximum quantity in storage units; produced by basic structs continuously
- basic resources are used for most things; the cost to do/build/create things in basic resources is used to check the pace of development 

Basic Factors:
- Production
- Happiness
- Taxation
- Dyus
- Dyr

- other objects/special resources can be harvested from outside or produced by special structs

- hero units: can be controlled by the player to do special things inside or outside the city; go on quests or adventures outside/inside the city

- city can grow, increasing its basic stats (such as population); gaining more avenues of development as it gets larger. Allows for considerable customization of the layout, appearance and structure of the city

- can claim objects/land outside your city

- can use special units to perform actions on the world map

- can acquire/develop technology/research that allows the city to do/make new/better things

- the ultimate point of developing the city is to be able to acquire/build aya-structs. The better the city, the better the aya-structs you will be able to build/acquire.

- can develop special "great" characters that can do many great things
  - your main "leader"character is one of these great units -> different races/classes have different bonuses

- there are many plots/stories/things to do

- can use special points, resources and technology to develop things/structs/buildings inside your city

- can make things or produce resources used to make or do things

- as the city's economy develops, it becomes capable to doing greater/better things, and engaging in ever greater depths of gameplay

 -can send forces out to fight or do things; can control hero character to go on quests/adventures or do things

 - leader (the player) gets a certain level of income based on how well the city is doing; seperate from the city's currency-generation which is used exclusively by the city

- can specialize/develop in many different ways; making each city unique. Can also take advantage of special objects possessed, other land controlled, and interactions with other cities to gain further powers/things.

- there are more possible structs to build in each city than there is space, and developing each takes a lot of investment to develop and sustain, so players need to pick what route they wish to develop. There is a lot of inter-city interaction; players can use their other cities to help out or the cities of friendy players.

- must acquire these building-structs and then "build" them into the city. Structs can be traded/used as items until they are built into the city; can be packed up later into item form, but lose all their developments. Because of limitations on the number of structs in a city, the cost of development, and many other factors, players will typically want to specialize, and emphasize the development of certain building structs or combinations of building structs

- many different ways to acquire these building structs. They can be incorporated into your city-struct, and developed. These structs can also be packed up and traded away or harvested for resources.

- can acquire many different types of items with many different kinds of uses. Can find items useful in other games, or for acquiring pets/structs, battle structs, aya-things, for building or developing structs, for building, developing or acquiring aya-things, and many other things
