[need to design base game-struct mechanics, as well as special mechanics for different classes of structs; system for players to create their own structs as well as create game-systems/theory/mechanics for their structs]

- game-structs can be involved in virtually any game-mechanics imaginable

- game-structs can []

- there are game-structs for any kind of game-mechanic that revolves around certain objects

- players can specify special game-mechanics for their structs

players can collect special game-structs, 

 receive them as rewards/prizes from special events/games/competitions/things


- can design special game-systems/mechanics associated with a fixed class of structs that is special to that struct
