[Abstract theories/concepts that create things of [value/want/desire/purpose/meaning/[transcendental great notions]]:

Special abstractions that help to formalize and encode notions that justify the player's reasoning/theory about how a component fits into gameplay and things like power, value, meaning, purpose, desireability, want, attractiveness, goodness, and many other things, including [special transcendental notions]. These special abstractions have special components that are [beyond our understanding] and it is these transcendental components that ultimately motivates me to want to acquire them and use them in game/[game-play + game-battle/compete with them] to make me [abstract concept here, the things I'm talking about, ex happiness that comes from having and playing with hot girls, abstract game-playing fun/happiness]

[more as I come up with it, these need to form the ultimate backbone to the theory of the games I am creating to ensure they are everything I want them to be]...


- Collection and use of items (and their effects and use in various situations, use/powers/value in the game world) as in Neopets

- provides the theoretical basis for creating things that players want to get, create, craft, acquire, win, etc.

-ex. stocks/shares: represent units of ownership/power over special powerful entities/corporations that do/have/[abstract concept] special things or have special values/power/things ex shares of a corporation that makes something or does something desireable/necessary/useful/[game-play mechanics-useful], provides a good/fun/important/powerful/game-play useful/good/powerful service, value is determined by how valuable the entity that stock belongs to and gives ownership/power in

Components/Mechanics of Civilization style long term, persistent world sandbox mmorpg strategy game

- civ-nodes/tiles: basic "territory" unit object/structure, nodes/tiles acquired contribute to your empire in some way, and you can develop them and assign automata/things to them to make them better; some can have special effects/text/data/info that make them special

- your empire will possess a set of nodes/tiles, each with its own data, which can be developed, have structs/objects added to them, contain special innate resources/things you can farm/acquire, have special powers/effects, possess special things you can use, and virtually anything else

ex. Basic "Production/Currency" tile: generates n production and m wealth

Structure:
[basic tile identifier] <type> {
data
} 


-------------------
Game Creation Mechanics:

- allows the player to create any kind of game/world using any kind of gameplay system/mechanics/objects they desire, and control their game, create instances they desire

Objects:

- game creation core
- blank game object template
- game system generator
- game mechanic-creating core

Mechanics:

- create game engine using special objects, system
- create game objects/systems/mechanics/player-characters/other-characters/story/world/[anything else]/[any transcendental/aynu thing] using the right objects and game-creation mechanics



ex. can create first-person open-world sandbox shooter MMORPG like "Destiny"
- can create physics/reality/life/[world where you can and are free to do anything imaginable] open-world sandbox like "Garry's Mod"
- can create strategy game like "Civilization" series
- can create any [transcendental/aynu game], including those that go beyond mortal comprehension, and whose fun-level is beyond anything describable
