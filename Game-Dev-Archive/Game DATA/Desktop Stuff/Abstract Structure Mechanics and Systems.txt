- essentially create a system for creating abstract struct/object/things/[abstract things] classes, abstract struct-objects, and the game-systems, game-mechanics, game-worlds, game-theory they live and interact with to get meaning
- can be used to create virtually any kind of game-thing/[game-abstraction-thing]/[game-aynu-thing]
- create the basic core objects/mechanics used to do this, which are also game-things
------------

- items can interact and do/be things under a wide variety of game mechanics and system, virtually limitless freedom to [abstract game-play] with objects in any way desired

- items can have pre-set actions/powers/values/effects that you can perform with them

- can also customize/develop/create/extend special objects (And templates) to create special interactions/powers/effects/game-system-things

- [can use special template and structure creation objects to develop any kind of abstract struct with any kind of [abstract thing/game] that has/is/[abstract symbol indicating some kind of abstract relationship]:

	-->[abstract desire/want/enjoy/toy-desire/enjoy-playing-with/want-because-it-creates-a-game-you-utterly-and-forever-enjoy-playing/abstract-game-desire/abstract-thing]]
	-->[abstract thing related to the abstract concepts I need to develop to do the things I want]
	



 - [can use special template and structure creation objects to develop any kind of abstract struct with any kind of [abstract thing/game]

(need to find a better way to structure information sheets)
Abstract Struct Creation system:

objects:




- [Abstract Struct Core: ]
[design format for distinguishing properties and structure of each struct core]
  - properties/components:
    - 2 system sockets
    - (data components) (structural use)


(add objects that can be used to create structure classes (including meta-data and abstract mechanics/systems), templates and struct-objects and give them anything, game-play-things, game-play-actions, game-play-powers/value/[raiku-things]
- abstract struct game component:
	template:
	packages:
	meta-data:
	data:
	format:
	[game-things]:
	[game-actions/powers/effects/system-engagement]:
	[special abstract components/data/essence/structure]:
	[things]:

ex.
basic struct-class creation core:
class name:
meta-data:
description:
game-interactions
game-system-things:
game-things
game-world-engagement:
player-character and game-object interactions/actions:


---------------------------------------------------------------


ex. basic struct creation core: format 1:

struct name
meta-data
[game-data]
[game-system=things]
[things; abstract-aynu-things]
[ ... ]
