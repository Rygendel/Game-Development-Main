Aggregate all major information about the game into a small number of easy-to-print text file. Major sub-components can be split into different files; special objects will get their own file/"card"/"info sheet"



Design way to track folder structure on the documents: have a header that indicates the folder structure

ex. [folder 1] > [folder 2] > [file]


Typical game folder structure:

[game-folder]
  > [Game Engine]
    > [Game Object Engine]
    > [Game World Engine]
  > [Game Database]
    > [Account Database]
    > [Item Database]
    > [Struct Database]
  > [Game Info]
    > [Item Catalogue]
    





[Move this stuff into a separate sheet for items]
Special Objects:

Game Creator: Does everything necessary to create any thing, any game-world, any [abstract aynu-thing], create a new reality with new laws/systems, create a [hot-girl] that will obey/do anything, or anything else you desire.


[Game-Winning-Object]: [The most powerful object in [game-world]].

[The ultimate-[object]]: 
Descr:[the ultimate thing to possess; every player will want this object and its value and desirability transcend our understanding]
[aynu-component]::[aynu][aynu]...
[component that helps determine and make-up the object, contains its essence]:
