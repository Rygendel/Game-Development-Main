Skills:

Skills allow players to engage in a variety, which when levelled grant characters access to new abilities and features, such as creating special items, casting new spells, and much more. Skills are levelled up by acquiring lessons with trainers or performing certain tasks. There is no cap on the level of any skill, but the ability to grow to the next level grows exponentially, and the benefit of levelling diminishes. Furthermore, players are occasionally presented with the choice of gaining one of three mutually exclusive talents with the skill at special points as their skill in any branch advances, further forcing players to specialize and distinguish themselves to suit their own needs, desires, and play style.
