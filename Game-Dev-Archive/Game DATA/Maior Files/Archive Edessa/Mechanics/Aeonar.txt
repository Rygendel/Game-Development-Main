Aeonar:

For lack of better terminology, the Aeonar are collection of highly abstract "concepts" and "ideas" through which certain theories and concepts are made manifest. Understanding of Aeonar can allow beings to endow entities with mechanics, meaning, understanding, value, desirability, certain firdawsian properties, and more. In particular, this is done through the endowment of the Aenarions, though this is not the only method.


The Aeonar have a special connections to the Sirions, Tirions, and "Firdaws".

The Immortal Words:

The immortal words embody and express special aeonar which are special transcendental properties and things which cannot be expressed using the concepts of mortals. They represent approximations of these special divus properties. Some of their related concepts, which are familiar to mortals include desirability, meaning, purpose, etc. These special aeoner, properties, and things are generally considered to be the greatest. When combined they may encode further things.

The Divine Glyphs:

They represent approximations of these special divus properties. Some of their related concepts, which are familiar to mortals include desirability, meaning, purpose, etc. These special aeoner, properties, and things are generally considered to be the greatest.

They are sometimes encoded with special symbols not contained in the latin alphabet.

When combined, they may encode further things.

They represent approximations of these special divus properties. Some of their related concepts, which are familiar to mortals include desirability, meaning, purpose, etc. These special aeoner, properties, and things are generally considered to be the greatest.

Aeternal Code:
--------------

Similarly to the immortal words and Divine Glyph, the aeternal code is a powerful tool which can embody and express special aeonar which are special transcendental properties and things which cannot be expressed using the concepts of mortals. They represent approximations of these special divus properties. Some of their related concepts, which are familiar to mortals include desirability, meaning, purpose, etc. These special aeoner, properties, and things are generally considered to be the greatest.
