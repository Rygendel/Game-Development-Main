Roleplaying and Scenarios:
--------------------------

Offer additional ways to specialize your character. You can create elements of your characters background, story, relationships, possessions, items, powers, interests, etc.

These are often done through guilds. Guilds are special organizations in which players may join or found. Being a member of a guild offers a number of benefits, such as special guild perks, a support system, people with which to run dungeons, raids, and battlegrounds, an environment in which to roleplay, and so on.
