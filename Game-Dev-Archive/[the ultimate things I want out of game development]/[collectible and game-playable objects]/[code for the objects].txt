var xanarion koriae ho megas eltell ho baeryl in cursus honorum


Find a nice way to write values/data for the objects. Also write the code documents used to give them game-meaning, game-things, and game-development. Everything is pure aynu; the game is a pure aynu-game with pure aynu game-dev.

Need to develop object data/stat/thing components, fields, [aynu-term], systems, values, parameters, and meaning.

Need to develop the [thing]/data/stat fields/components/[aynu-term] and their values, systems, meaning, game-dev, etc. May give each component its own document or put them all in one. Will use pure aynu code to develop them.

For example (examples of fields/component/[aynu-term] and their values):

[thing]:: { 9879434 / 89798724 / 32804928 }

[thing]:: var xanarion koriae ho megas eltell ho baeryl in cursus honorum

[thing]:: symbols...with formatting/structure symbols/spacing/things

[thing]:: { [aynu] / [aynu] / [aynu] }

[thing]:: [aynu]... with formatting/structure symbols/spacing/things
