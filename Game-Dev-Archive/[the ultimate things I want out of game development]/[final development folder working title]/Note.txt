These include warfare, space-warfare, base building, civ-empire development and competition, ..., (more to develop), ..., and virtualy any other kind of game, including any pure aynu-games. Can also play pure-aynu-games and collect pure-aynu-objects that can be used in the game. Can also play player-developed games and player-created/developed games. Can interact with and engage in [aynu-gameplay] with player developed standard games and pure-aynu-games. Can possess and game-play with player created objects/structs and [pure-aynu objects/structs like Elu, Sylyn, Feanor, etc.]. Players can develop their own objects/structs, including pure-aynu objects/structs, and these are fully integrated into the game-world and can be interacted with and game-played with just like any other objects/structs (including the ability to sell and trade them).
