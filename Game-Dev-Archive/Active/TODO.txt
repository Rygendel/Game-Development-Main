TODO:

- develop pet-structs and struct gameplay-mechanics/abilities/powers/things/[aynu-things]
  - develop things like moves, skills, items, powers, gameplay-effects (like increased drop rate and increased rarity of items)

- prepare documents for printing, create a strategy and start by adding titles/folder and document structure information to documents
  -> example: if a document is called blahblahblah.docx make the title of the document blahblahblah and maybe add folder info


- find a way to edit docx files: maybe purchase microsoft office/word


------------

- develop struct game-data and their game-effects, game-dev, aynu-game-things, [game-world-things], game-stat-effects-powers-things, game-systems, [aynu-game-mechanics/systems/[aynu-things]], [Iulion], [Adrion], behaviour, ..., [more to develop/aynu-develop], and anything else
- everything should contain a complete description/text/data/code/writing of its game-dev, game-mechanics, game-systems and anything else about it, and everything needed to implement and create it in the game; game-structs and their game-mechanics and game-powers, ..., [more to develop/aynu-develop], and all other game-dev-things (including aynu-things) should be completely encoded in their document and not require external descriptions/engines to implement or create it in the game
