[encode everything needed to create the struct's gameplay things, mechanics, systems, engine, [game-dev-things], [aynu-game-dev], [game-dev], [aynu-game-dev-mechanics-systems], [aynu-game-engine-things], ..., [more to develop], [everything necessary to fully create the theory of the structs and all of their possible functions, properties, things, [aynu-things], mechanics, behaviour, powers, [aynu], and anything else about them in the game and game-dev] (and aynu-versions) and anything and everything about the struct in the game not encoded in its data-sheet (though for many structs they don't need this since they are "stand-alone" and have all of these things encoded in their game-data-sheet/doc)]
