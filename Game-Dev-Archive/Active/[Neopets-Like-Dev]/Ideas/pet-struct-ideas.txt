Ideas for pet-struct builds:
 
Zygarde - high defenses
- land's wrath -> make an enemy vulnerable to [Ground/Nature] type icons/attacks
- Defender of the land -> damage/icons determined by the user's defenses
 [picture: a shield-like force-field builds around fists, which is then used to strike the enemy]
