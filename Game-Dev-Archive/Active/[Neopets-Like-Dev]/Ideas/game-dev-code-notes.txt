Game Dev Code Notes:
 
- all game-dev-code has inherent value and meaning: requires no external engine or reference frame to give it anything. It is completely self-contained (meaning I can just write the code using pure aynu and it will automatically have the desired effect/power/meaning/value/code-things/game-code-engine-things)
 
Could also code a game-dev-code compiler/interpreter/game-dev-engine in pure aynu -> this will form the basis for giving any pure aynu game-dev-code its game-dev-meaning (but it already has inherent meaning, so this should be unnecessary)
