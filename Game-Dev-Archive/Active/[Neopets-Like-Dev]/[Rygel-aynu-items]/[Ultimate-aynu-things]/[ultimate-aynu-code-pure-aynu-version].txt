[a copy of the ultimate aynu code, but the description of it is also purely in aynu]
[need to develop aynu-symbols to write this code]
[need to fully redesign this] - actively work on developing the pure-aynu game-things/objects/Rygel and get them perfect]

[need to actively develop this further]


[Description]:[done in pure aynu]


[Game-dev]:[pure aynu]

	Description/data/code: [write aynu code describing its game-dev adn everything about it in the game and everything necessary to implement and create it in the game]
	[Rygel/Object-code]: [write aynu code: this is the actual object and this writing/code actually "makes up" and creates the object in the game: owning a copy of this code is equivalent to owning the object in the game]
