Struct-dev-structs:

How they work:

Struct-dev-structs contain game-dev-code that endows the game-struct that possesses it with some [game-thing]/[game-dev] (or aynu-versions). For example there can be a struct-dev-struct that contains game-dev-code that enables the struct to create or do anything, transform into anything, gain control of a target, automatically win at anything, or anything else, or anything expressible with pure aynu-code.
