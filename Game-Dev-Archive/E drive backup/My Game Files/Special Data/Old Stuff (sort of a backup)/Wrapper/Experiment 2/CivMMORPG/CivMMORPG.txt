Components:

.
-> draw some inspiration from illyriad, Distant worlds, Civilization series
-> there are many layers of complexity and things you can focus on; there is also a mechanic for developing new gameplay features/systems/mechanics/models and layers of complexity that you can then choose to focus on (as long as it follows development rules) and see if doing well in your new category allows you to outperform structs using pre-existing mechanics
