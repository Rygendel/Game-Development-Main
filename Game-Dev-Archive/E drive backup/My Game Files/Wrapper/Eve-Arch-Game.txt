Design the arch-game based on EVE Online. Use data from Eve, including items, as a basis for the arch game. Code engines that do things similar to Eve. Design a space world similar to Eve, and players can engage in the same kinds of activities and gameplay as they do in Eve, and more.

- however, may start with a Pokemon/Neopets like game base on a single world, use Eve for the rest, or have players choose to live in the pokemon/neopets arch-game or the Eve-arch-game, with the ability to interact between the two and exchange items and things; can even have one as a subgame of the other depending on which you choose as your main.

	-> start simple, with a neopets-like basis eventually expanding to encompass a pokemon-like component as well and eventually an EVE online structure


- can fight for control of worlds with special things in them
- build massive corporations and social structures that can go to war
- use blueprints to build ships and other mechs, including ground forces
- engage in character vs. character combat or ship combat (space and planetary combat)
- build bases on planets you control or in orbit, mine valuable things from them
- players can create defenses for their planets and bases/colonies, and fight other players for control; there are also "ultimate defenses" that are unbreachable which players can set up at great cost on a few planets to create "safe havens" for themselves and their stuff, and can (and should) store most of their stuff in these safe havens

- on a large scale, player alliances and forces can fight for control of star systems



- combat types: 
	-> icon turn-based
	-> character battling Path of Exile Style
	-> Mech Battles in real time using their own powers, abilities, stats, items, gear, aynu-things, etc.
	-> General Mech
	-> Turn based civ-empire strategy
	-> Ship battles (similar to Mech, possibly even a subclass)
