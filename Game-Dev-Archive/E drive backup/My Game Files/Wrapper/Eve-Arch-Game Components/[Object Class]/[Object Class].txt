Write everything about the object class here.

ex: Buildings: write about buildings, how they work, what kinds of effects they can have on gameplay (ex. manufacture items/units, generate resources, provide services, cast effects, and anything else, or have any other effect or use; similar to buildings in Age of Empires, Civilization, and Battle for Middle Earth)

Also create template for object data files, and the engine for processing them and integrating them into gameplay, write everything needed to understand the objects (ike a wiki page) and implement them in the game (like the game code/engine).
