General format for these Pokemon/Neopets Structs:
- these are technically a special subclass of mechs

[Name]: - name chosen by the player; defaults to species name
[Species]:
[Type]:
[Id]:
[Meta-data]: - include flavour data; special other data
	     - gender
	     - social characteristics

[Artwork and appearance-customization]: - basic artwork is based on the type and species; artwork used to render object in the game world and its movement and "physical extent/presence/actions/things" within the 3D open-world game world
					- players can develop and modify their physical features, clothing, makeup, weapon effects, special "cool" appearance effects, armour artwork, and many other facets of their physical presence and appearance

Battle Stats:
[Nature/Talent/Focus]:   - customization feature that lets players choose the focus of their structs; can boost some areas by a certain percentage by decreasing other areas by the same percentage
			- ex. 20 points overall: can increase any set of areas by a total percentage adding up to 20% at the cost of decreasing other areas by the same percentage
[Characteristics]: - special extra features that make each struct special; randomized
		   - ex. may get a certain percentage boost to certain areas
		   - different characteristics may be restricted to certain kinds of structs
[Icon Generation]: - icons generated by the struct; used to engage in combat or do things
[Items]:  - items held by the struct; any items can be held, but certain kinds of items can be extremely useful in battle; if an item doesn't specify any additional properties, it automatically adds one icon of [normal/standard]
	  - some items can only be used by certain species
	  - some items are useful in combat; some items are useful in other areas of gameplay (outside of combat)

[Powers]: - Special things the struct can do during combat; some may depend on the use/spending of icons
	  - some powers can only be used by certain species
	  - some powers are useful in combat; some powers are useful in other areas of gameplay (outside of combat)

[Stats]: - special data values that determine a struct's skill at certain things; some are useful in combat, some are useful in other areas of gameplay utside of combat
         - some stats may be held by certain types of structs, or structs that have gone through a special process to acquire them (ex. training)

	common stats:	- Health, Atk, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed
			- power, skill, dexterity, intelligence, beauty
			- world skills: creativity, metallurgy, alchemy, engineering, artistry, [cool-thing], [activity-skill]
			- [stat relevant to a special game-play thing such that the better this stat is, the better the struct is at that game-play thing]
			- [special stat that makes the struct more desireable/collectable/useful/powerful/good/great/aynu-thing the better it is]
			- [special abstract-aynu stat; players will want to find structs that have certain data-values for this stat depending on what their game-play desires/goals/purpose/values/meaning/[aynu-theory-thing are]]
			-  [special abstract-aynu stat; players will want to find structs that have certain data-values for this stat for [abstract-aynu desires/reasons/theory]
			- [any other data-things]
			- [things]
			




[Aynu-data]: special aynu-things the struct possesses
