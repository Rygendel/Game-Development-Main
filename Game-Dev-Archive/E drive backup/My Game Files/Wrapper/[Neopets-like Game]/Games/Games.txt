- these are sub-games within the larger neopets-like game that players can participate in
- each game has its own mechanics; and players may be able to use resources, items, structs, pets and other things to participate in it
- these games are intended to be fun, and many have rewards/prizes/things and can have effects on the Larger game world

-> the Neopets-like game world can have an effect on the games, and the games can have an effect on the Neopets like game world
-> some sub-games have dedicated objects that can be acquired in the Arch-game and used in the sub-game or other game; some can use your pets abilities or those of other structs

-> playing games can have many effects that go beyond the sub-game environment, the sub-game environment can be integrated into the game world

-> games can be anything really


-> eg. develop a turn based party-game similar to Keyquest
-> make a game based on developing a self-sustaining and automata-run ecosystem/civ-system structure similar to Neopets Habitarium
