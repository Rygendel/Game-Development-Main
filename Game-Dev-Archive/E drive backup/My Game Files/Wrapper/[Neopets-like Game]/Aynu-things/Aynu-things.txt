[Work on actually creating the great aynu things; can form the basis of the megas, great objects that can do and are everything I want]
[merge these things with the ultimate and greatest objects coded entirely in aynu]
[write aynu-code to encode all the abstract-aynu mechanics/theory/purpose/meaning/powers and other [abstract-aynu-things] and game-things about these aynu-things that I desire; this results in the creation of a game-system involving these aynu-things that I enjoy and find interesting; motivates collecting, possessing, useing, [doing aynu-things with], and game-playing with these aynu-things]
[the aynu-code creates the ultimate game-world I want and makes these aynu-things the ultimate things I want to possess and game-play with within this world]
