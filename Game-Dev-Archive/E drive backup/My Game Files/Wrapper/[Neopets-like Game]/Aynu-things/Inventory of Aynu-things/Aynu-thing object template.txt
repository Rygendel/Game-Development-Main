Need to design the format and structure for these aynu-things, make it aesthetically pleasing and make me (and other players) want to possess, collect, and engage in game-play with certain aynu-things that have the things that the player desires. Different players may desire different things, since different aynu-things can lead to and engage in different kinds of game-play and game-things, have different value/effects/powers/things/[abstract things] on the game.
