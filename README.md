Main Game Development
This is a compilation of related game-development documents and code. This comprises my effort to create a game with open persistent world mmorpg type gameplay with extensive lore players may interact with, valuable and desirable objects and game-structures to collect. I would also like to incorporate some eve-like ship-building gameplay where players use game-structures that have some core stats that are modified by objects players add to the structure.
