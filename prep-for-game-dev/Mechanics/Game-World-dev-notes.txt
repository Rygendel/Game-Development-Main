- game assets
- persistent world

- develop game system for handling everything or entity that can be identified, named, addressed or handled, in any way whatsoever

- develop game assets, including visuals/graphics

- develop sandbox game components and freedom for players to play and develop their own path in the game

- there is no end to the game; there will always be more things and activities to explore and do in the game and new content, campaigns, stories, and other game content is continuously being added

- player characters exist in an open, persistent, shared sandbox world where the main gameplay takes place, including things like quests and story activities

- shared with other players

- the game is continuously being expanded and all account characters, items, and all other possessions are carried over and persistent across all updates to the game
